<p id="a"> We need to take action because poor eating habits are harming the health and well-being of children and teens. Many kids are becoming malnourished, overweight, or developing serious health problems like diabetes and heart disease, all because of unhealthy diets. Poor nutrition also affects energy levels, concentration, and mood, making it harder for
 students to do well in school and enjoy daily activities. By taking action, we can educate others about the importance of healthy eating, prevent future health problems, and create a community where everyone has the knowledge and support to make better food choices. Acting now can help children and families live healthier, happier lives.
</p>
<p id="b"> We can take action in our advocacy by raising awareness about the dangers of poor eating habits. This includes talking to classmates, friends, and family about healthy nutrition, sharing facts, posters, and social media posts, and even organizing school talks or mini-workshops. We can also promote healthy eating in school by encouraging students to choose fruits, vegetables, and clean meals, and by creating fun activities like trying healthy snacks or colorful meals for a week. 
Providing resources, such as simple guides on nutritious meals and safe food preparation, can help families make better choices. Most importantly, we can lead by example by practicing healthy eating ourselves, showing that making good food choices can be enjoyable, and motivating others to join our advocacy for a healthier community.
