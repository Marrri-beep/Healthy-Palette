<p clear id="p1" style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">One fateful day, I was in class and overheard from my classmate how they were on a diet, their reason being is that they want to get skinnier. My classmate thinks they look fat, they said that, and I was baffled! They seemed to be in average shape. I realized how dangerous this was, especially since that classmate’s diet plan is to not eat anything, just so they can lose weight. 
</p>

<p id="p2" style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">I feared that unhealthy eating habits and extreme dieting could cause more harm than good. I realized that no one should ever harm or starve themselves, and that wanting to lose weight just to achieve a so-called “perfect” body is dangerous and unnecessary. That experience really upset me, and I felt the need to share my thoughts with my friends. We started talking about our own experiences with poor eating habits, and hearing everyone’s stories made me feel sick and worried about how common these problems are. I wished I could do something to prevent people from suffering in this way, and then it hit me — that wish was possible! I realized that I could take action and make a difference. Motivated by this, I gathered my friends and shared the idea of
     forming a group to advocate against poor eating habits. To my surprise and excitement, they all agreed right away. Together, we decided to work as a team to raise awareness, educate others about healthy eating, and help prevent children and teens from facing the same struggles we had learned about. That moment marked the beginning of our advocacy journey, and it showed me that even small actions can grow into meaningful change when people come together for a good cause.</p>

<p id="int" style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">This is me, the head of our group! My name is Gabrielle Mari V. Siangco, but you can call me Mari. I am 14 years old and currently study at Philippine Science High School. 
    I have always dreamed of helping others overcome their problems, whether big or small, and this has been a driving force in everything I do. One of the reasons I decided to form this advocacy is because I want to make a positive difference in the lives of children
     and teens who struggle with poor eating habits. I believe that by raising awareness, educating others, and encouraging healthy choices, we can prevent the physical and emotional problems that come from unhealthy diets. Leading this group allows me to turn my passion
      into action and inspire others to join me in making our community healthier and stronger.</p>
