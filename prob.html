<p id="f">Bad eating habits have become a serious issue today, especially among children and teenagers. Many young people eat too much unhealthy food such as fast food, sugary snacks, and processed meals. These foods are often high in fat, sugar, and salt but low in nutrients.
 Because they are cheap, tasty, and easy to buy, kids choose them over healthier options. Another problem is the consumption of unclean or unsafe food, which can cause stomach infections, food poisoning, and long-term health issues.</p>
<p id="r">Malnutrition is also a major concern. Some children become undernourished because they do not get enough vitamins, minerals, and protein. This can lead to being underweight, weak immune systems, slower growth, and difficulty concentrating in school. On the other hand,
 some children become overweight or obese due to eating too much junk food and not having a balanced diet. Obesity can lead to serious conditions such as diabetes, heart problems, and low self-esteem.</p>
<p id="t">These problems often come from a lack of education about healthy eating, busy family schedules, or financial difficulties that make it hard to buy nutritious food. Many kids also follow what they see online or from friends, which often promotes unhealthy choices. Because
 of these issues, it is important to raise awareness about proper nutrition, teach children how to make better food choices, and help families access cleaner and healthier food. Your advocacy aims to address these problems and encourage better eating habits for a healthier future.
